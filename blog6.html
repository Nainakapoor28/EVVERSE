            <p class="justify-text">India’s shift toward electric mobility is growing rapidly, and several cities are playing a major role in accelerating this transformation. These cities stand out because of their strong policies, expanding charging infrastructure, rising consumer adoption, and support from local governments. Together, they are shaping the future of clean transportation in India and inspiring other regions to follow. Here’s a closer look at the five cities that are truly leading India’s EV revolution.</p>
            <p class="justify-text">Delhi has emerged as one of the strongest contenders in the EV movement. The Delhi government introduced a highly progressive EV policy that focuses on reducing pollution, providing incentives, and building a reliable charging network across the city. Today, Delhi has a large number of public chargers and EV-friendly parking zones. The city’s awareness campaigns and subsidies have encouraged thousands of residents to shift to electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and cars. With more charging points being added every year, Delhi continues to set a benchmark for EV adoption in India.</p>
            <p class="justify-text">Bengaluru is another city in the front seat of India’s electric transition. As the country’s technology hub, Bengaluru benefits from strong innovation, early adoption of new tech, and the presence of several EV startups and charging solution companies. The city has one of the largest public charging networks, making it easy for EV owners to travel across the region. Bengaluru’s forward-thinking mindset, combined with active government participation, has helped create a highly supportive environment for the EV ecosystem.</p>
            <p class="justify-text">Mumbai, India’s financial capital, is quickly strengthening its place in the EV market. The city’s increasing number of charging stations, including those in parking lots, malls, and residential areas, reflects the growing interest among residents. Mumbai’s dense urban landscape makes electric vehicles especially appealing due to lower running costs and reduced emissions. The Maharashtra state government’s incentives and EV-friendly policies have further encouraged both private and commercial adoption, making Mumbai a key player in the country’s shift to electric mobility.</p>
            <p class="justify-text">Hyderabad is also making impressive progress in promoting electric vehicles. The Telangana government has focused on building a strong EV manufacturing and charging ecosystem, attracting global and Indian companies to set up factories and charging solutions. As public chargers expand across highways and key city areas, more people are choosing electric vehicles for both personal and business use. Hyderabad’s emphasis on innovation and long-term planning is helping it become an important EV hub in South India.</p>
            <p class="justify-text">Pune completes the list as one of the most proactive cities in supporting electric mobility. Known for its automotive industry presence, Pune has naturally embraced the transition to EVs. The city has seen significant growth in electric two-wheelers, e-auto rickshaws, and electric buses on public routes. With strong support from the Maharashtra government and an increasing network of chargers, Pune is shaping a greener and more energy-efficient transport system for the future.</p>
            <p class="justify-text">Together, these five cities represent the heart of India’s EV movement. Each city contributes in its own way—through policy, infrastructure, industry support, or consumer adoption. As charging networks expand and more people experience the benefits of electric mobility, these cities will continue leading India toward a cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable future.</p>
