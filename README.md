EVVerse – Smart EV Charging Recommendation System

EVVerse is a machine learning–based web application designed to help electric vehicle (EV) users locate the nearest EV charging stations in India. The system uses geospatial analysis and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to provide accurate, distance-based charging station recommendations through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

Project Overview

With the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, EV users often face range anxiety due to scattered and unreliable charging infrastructure information. EVVerse addresses this problem by offering a centralized, intelligent, and easy-to-use platform that recommends nearby charging stations based on user location.
This project was developed as a Minor Project for the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) program.

Objectives

Reduce range anxiety for EV users, Provide accurate nearest charging station recommendations, Demonstrate the practical use of machine learning + geospatial data, Build a complete frontend–backend integrated prototype

Key Features

Nearest Charging Station Recommendation using KNN, Manual & Automatic Location Detection, Haversine Distance Calculation for geographic accuracy, Google Maps & Folium Map Integration, Fallback Recommendation when no station exists in a selected city, Informational Pages on EV batteries, charging levels, and blogs, Responsive & Modern UI

Machine Learning Approach

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Distance Metric: Haversine Formula, Input: Latitude & Longitude
Output: Nearest EV charging stations ranked by distance, The model is trained on a cleaned and normalized dataset of EV charging stations across India.

Tech Stack

Backend: Python 3, Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Geopy
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Maps & Visualization: Google Maps API, Folium

Future Enhancements

Real-time charging station availability, User login & profile system, Online deployment (AWS / Azure), EV route optimization, Ratings & reviews for charging stations, Mobile app integration
